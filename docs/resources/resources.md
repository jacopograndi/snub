## resources

### design
Player resources are
- T (Tetrahedrons) - white
- k (kis) - green
- a (ambo) - red
- d (dual) - blue
- s (snub) - yellow
- lives - purple

Each time an enemy is damaged, it gives the resource equal to its last operator. So if daT is damaged, d is gained, if T is damaged, T is gained and if sT is damaged, s is gained.

- T is used to buy turrets and upgrades.
- k, a, d, s are used to buy modules.

Another way to generate resources is to buy finance generators and modules for them. 

At the end of each wave, generator produce and 1 life is gained. 
TODO: There may be a generator module to increase the life gain.

When an enemy reaches the end of the path, it removes lives equal to its current life total.
