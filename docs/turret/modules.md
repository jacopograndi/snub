## modules

### documentation
Modules are power ups for turrets. They cost kads, not T, and are the main sink for those resources. Each turret defines how many module can be installed to it max. Multiple modules sum their contributions. Each module using the same resources costs more (doubling each time).

Modules are shown in the game as attached boxes to the gun.
